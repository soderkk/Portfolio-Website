            I've been apart of
            <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc"
              >FIRST Robotics</a
            >
            for 2 years now on
            <a href="https://www.5406.ca">Team 5406 Celt-X</a>, and I've loved
            every second of it. It's actually the main reason I wanted to go to
            BR in the first place! I'm currently on Celt-X's subteam
            Programming, and I have been for 2 years. This year, I got the
            chance to work with AI a bit and my main project was our object
            detection for cones and cubes.

            This year, the game involved placing cones and cubes onto a grid, so
            we decided it would be beneficial to be able to detect the cones and
            cubes automatically. This led us to us eventually using an OrangePi
            to train an AI a model full of hundreds of images of cones and cubes
            in different lighting, positions etc, and through that training, the
            AI then knew what cones and cubes looked like, and could then detect
            them. It essentially knows the characteristics of each object, so it
            doesn't just go off of colour, making it far more accurate. You can
            do this with virtually anything - a lot of the example models I
            played around with used everyday objects, people, cars, couches, you
            name it. Eventually we were able to feed it a live camera stream,
            and got it to draw a box around cones and cubes. After that, each
            box was assigned an id so we could track the objects as well as
            detect them.

            I honestly don't take enough photos, but here are some of the things
            I've made (left out are the churros, bagels, biscotti, a sponge
            cake, cookie cheesecake bites, and eclairs I've made):
