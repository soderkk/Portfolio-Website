          <h3 id="PC" class="sub">PC Build</h3>
          <p>
            Up until this project, I had 0 experience building computers or
            ANYTHING. This project originally terrified me, especially knowing
            that my team had no idea what we were doing, but we ended up doing a
            great job, and it was a really rewarding experience!
          </p>

          <p>
            You can't see it in this photo, but we actually put stickers on the
            PC and made it retro inspired. Originally we wanted an older PC case
            for it too, but we realized that it would've been a) a lot of work
            b) way less efficient and c) cost a lot or be next to impossible to
            obtain, so we went with the stickers and a retro task bar instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm really proud of what we accomplished, and the fact that this
            computer actually works quite well just goes to show how capable we
            all are if we put the effort in.

          <h3 class="sub">Smiley Face Circuit</h3>
          <p>
            Surprisingly, they let kids use a 400 degree stick in schools, so
            that's exactly what we learned how to use (safely of course). After
            passing the mandatory safety quiz, we got started on learning how to
            solder on a smiley face PCB. <br />
            Here's the back:

          <p>Aaaand it working:</p>
          <img src="images/smiley-front.jpg" width="500" />
          <p>
            Pretty neat, right? <br />
            This year I made my second smiley face, and despite how daunting
            soldering may appear, it's actually really fun!

          <p>
            We were given a bonus task to make a fully customizable rainbow LED
            using either pure electronics or a mix of arduino and hardware. I
            ended up going with pure electronics since it was far simpler.

          <h3 class="sub">4 LEDs controlled by a Potentiometer</h3>
          <p>
            Our final task for the electronics unit was to control whether 1, 2,
            3, 4, or no LEDs were on using a potentiometer and an arduino. This
            meant that we would essentially divide 1023 (all the possible values
            on a potentiometer) evenly amongst the number of LEDs to figure out
            the increments for each LED turning on, and go from there.

            TinkerCAD is a great way to explore electronics without the need to
            buy parts or worry about breaking anything. It's also pretty
            beginner friendly with all of their example projects. It's also
            really nice to be able to ideate before actually building the
            physical circuit, just to make sure it works first.
